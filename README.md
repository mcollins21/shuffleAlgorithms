### List of Algorithms

Here's a short but useful list of algorithms that could be used 
for shuffling a list of numbers. Most of the examples shuffle through numbers 1 through 10.
Many of these are targeted towards music related tasks but could also be used in other 
applications. These have been specifically geared towards Kotlin 
developers but the idea is to develop more of these.


-- General Algorithms --

    Lagged Fibonacci shuffle
    Inside-out shuffle
    Random swapping
    Sattolo's algorithm
    Pseudorandom number generator shuffle 
    Cutoff shuffle
    Reverse Bogosort shuffle
    Strand shuffle
    Riffle shuffle
    Faro shuffle

-- Specifically Music Related -- 

    Genre-based shuffle
    Mood-based shuffle
    Energy-based shuffle
    Release year-based shuffle
    Artist-based shuffle
    Duration-based shuffle
    Popularity-based shuffle
    Album-based shuffle
    Dynamic mood-based shuffle
    Collaborative filtering shuffle

This is an ever-growing list so feel free to reach out if you have 
a more efficent solution or if you think something else should be 
added to the list.
